## Summary

A drawback of this website is the data hasnt been fully cleaned. There are multiple time formats, and all the data is in lowercase.

To improve this website I would recommend applying a set time format to the data. I would also recommend capitalizing the city and state names as that is how the user will most likely search for the data.
